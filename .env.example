# --- Google AI (Optional) ---
# If you plan to use Generative AI features with Google models
# GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY

# --- Database Configuration (Required) ---
# These are used by the Next.js application to connect to the database
DB_HOST=localhost       # Use 'db' when running with docker-compose
DB_USER=helpdesk_user   # Replace with your desired database username
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password # Replace with your desired database password
DB_NAME=helpdesk_db     # Replace with your desired database name
DB_PORT=3306            # Default MariaDB/MySQL port (optional if default)

# --- MariaDB Docker Container Configuration (Used by docker-compose.yml) ---
# These are used specifically to configure the MariaDB container itself
MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_very_secure_root_password # Choose a strong root password for the DB container
# MARIADB_DATABASE, MARIADB_USER, MARIADB_PASSWORD should match DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD above
# if you want docker-compose to create the user and database automatically.
# If you manually create the user/db, these might not be strictly needed,
# but providing them ensures consistency.

# --- Next.js ---
# PORT=9002 # Already set in package.json dev script and Dockerfile

# --- Authentication (Example for NextAuth, if used later) ---
# NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:9002
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET=YOUR_STRONG_SECRET_KEY_HERE
